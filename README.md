Spotbox
=======

A .NET Spotify Server.

Very early stages at the moment.

The goal is to create a windows-based spotify instance that can be controlled over the web via http calls.


# Installation

1) Rename `App.example.config` to `App.config` and replace spotify username, password and key location with your own account details

(Nuget packages should be restored automatically when the solution is built)
